#Fizzbuzz tests

This is my fizzbuzz tests done using rspec.

This was done by creating the functions to check if the value is divisiable by 3 or 5, Afterwards these functions were then put into a loop.

Within the loop it will check if the conditions of these values are true before printing "Fizzbuzz", "Fizz" or "Buzz".

To test a value change the values in the tests to run it against the fizzbuzz.rb file. To run the tests run rspec from the terminal.
